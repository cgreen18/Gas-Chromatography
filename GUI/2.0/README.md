# Version 2.0
I saw my friend, Harrison, has a github on rockets with a bunch of versions, some stable. As the software finally does the bare minimum, data collection, gathering, and saving; I wanted to save it.

Features:
Bare minimum. Live plotting and saving of figures. I think saving as .gc is broken.
