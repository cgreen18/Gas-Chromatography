# Gas Chromatography Capstone Project
The senior capstone project by Conor Green and Matt McPartlan to fulfill degree requirements for a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Loyola Marymount University. The objective is to design a economic, diode based gas chromatography (GC) detector.

## Three Main Components 
* [Analog voltage measurement](https://github.com/cgreen18/Gas-Chromatography/tree/master/Voltage%20Measurement)
* [Heating](https://github.com/cgreen18/Gas-Chromatography/tree/master/Heating)
* [Analog to digital conversion (ADC)](https://github.com/cgreen18/Gas-Chromatography/tree/master/ADC)

## Additional Requirements
* Graphical user interface (GUI)
* Auto-injector

### Gow-mac Detector
Our current prototype uses the shell of an old Gow-mac GC.
