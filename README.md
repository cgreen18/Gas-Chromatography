# Gas Chromatography Capstone Project
The senior capstone project by Conor Green and Matt McPartlan to fulfill degree requirements for a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Loyola Marymount University. The objective is to design a economic, diode based gas chromatography (GC) detector.

## Three Focii
* Analog voltage measurement
* Heating
* Analog to digital conversion (ADC)

## Additional Requirements
* Graphical user interface (GUI)
* Auto-injector

### Gow-mac Detector
Our current prototype uses the shell of an old Gow-mac GC.
