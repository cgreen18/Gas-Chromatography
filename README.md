# Gas Chromatography Capstone Project
The senior capstone project by Conor Green and Matt McPartlan to fulfill degree requirements for a B.S. in Electrical Engineering at Loyola Marymount University. The objective is to design a economic, diode based gas chromatography (GC) detector. As part of the requirements of a capstone project, we created a [website](https://gaschromatographycapstone.wordpress.com/), with weekly updates.

## Background on Gas Chromatography
Matt has written a great explanation and justification for this project in the document "[Introduction to Chromatography](https://github.com/cgreen18/Gas-Chromatography/blob/master/Documentation/Introduction%20to%20Chromatography.pdf)."

## Two Software Components 
* [Heating](https://github.com/cgreen18/Gas-Chromatography/tree/master/Heating)
* [Graphical user interface (GUI)](https://github.com/cgreen18/Gas-Chromatography/tree/master/GUI)

## Installation
There are automatic installation and configuration scripts, install.sh and config.sh, respectively, located in the [Installation Folder](https://github.com/cgreen18/Gas-Chromatography/tree/master/Installation)

## Versions and Branches
Older versions are saved as branches. Current version is very similar to version 4.0, which is actually a little broken on edge cases.
|Version     | Date | Features | Branch |
|:-----------|:--------|:--------|:--------|
| 1.0 | 24 November 2019 | Initial Creation. | None |
| 2.0 | 21 April 2020 | Successfully graphs live data with play button, graphs it live, saves images and .gc files, and clears. Basic, minimum GC supporting software. | [Contains-v3-of-GUI](https://github.com/cgreen18/Gas-Chromatography/tree/Contains-v3-of-GUI/GUI) |
| 3.0 | 24 April 2020 | Arduino serial interface. Temperature control and feedback thread. Normalize, integrate, and clean time menu functions. | [Contains-v3-of-GUI](https://github.com/cgreen18/Gas-Chromatography/tree/Contains-v3-of-GUI/GUI) |
| 4.0 | 27 April 2020 | Finalized. Many features, see README.md of 4.0_Version folder. | [Version_4.0](https://github.com/cgreen18/Gas-Chromatography/tree/Version_4.0/GUI) |
| Current | 27 April 2020 | Working to make executable/binary file. | [Master (here)](https://github.com/cgreen18/Gas-Chromatography/tree/master/GUI) |

## Team Member Biographies

#### Conor Green
> Conor Green is a Computer Engineering major at Loyola Marymount University, enrolled in the Honors College and pursuing a minor in Applied Mathematics. Every semester he has made Dean’s list and was invited and accepted into the engineering honor’s fraternity, Tau Beta Pi. Through the Honors department, Conor proposed, managed, and presented a $5000 research project on modifying the torque-slip characteristics of an induction motor through electro-plating that found significant results. Additionally, he was part of a team led by professor Dr. Huang to use computer vision to identify potholes from dash cam pictures in the Los Angeles area. Conor recently presented the induction motor and pothole research projects at This Is Honors and Undergraduate Research Symposium, respectively, at his university. In the summer of 2019 he participated in a NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates for Smart UAVs at Auburn University to model the interior of a building through Flash LiDAR without GPS. The results were novel and a technical report was written and published in the Computer Science and Software Engineering department of AU. In his senior year at LMU, Conor’s capstone project was to devise a cheap, easy-to-use, air or nitrogen based gas chromatography instrument. He will attend Purdue University in Fall 2020 as a Ph.D. student studying computer architecture.

> Conor has consistently worked various jobs since he turned sixteen, including multiple summers of full time work and private and volunteer tutoring (mainly mathematics.) He has worked at his university’s bike shop, the Cycling Lion, since its inception and is starting his second year as a manager. Outside of academics and work, Conor is the Vice-President of his university’s rugby team and has participated in the UAV national competition SAE Aero West. He speaks Spanish fluently through classes and talking with close friends. Conor studied abroad in Madrid, Spain, for a semester his sophomore year and has roadtripped across the United States vertically and horizontally.
