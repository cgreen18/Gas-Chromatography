three_element_heat_control.ino measures the temperature of the oven, injector, and detector via thermocouples. Two [RoboDyn AC Light Dimmer](https://robotdyn.com/ac-light-dimmer-module-1-channel-3-3v-5v-logic-ac-50-60hz-220v-110v.html) were used to heat the elements: one dimmer for the oven and the other for the injector and detector together.
